## Getting started with @zettel/core and @zettel/react

Right now we only have the packages `core` and `react`, you'll need those to get started.

```
yarn add @zettel/core @zettel/react
```

Now that you have them installed, here's a basic example of a plaintext editor:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react'
import { EditorState } from '@zettel/core'
import Editor from '@zettel/react'

const text = `[One üòÖLine][And another line of text][And another line]`

const App = () => {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(() => EditorState.fromJSON({
    text,
    ranges: [],
    entityMap: {}
  }))

  return (
    <Editor
      htmlAttrs={{ spellCheck: false, autoFocus: true, className: 'editor'}}
      onChange={setEditorState}
      editorState={editorState}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```
